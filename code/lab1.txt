# SETUP
# ------------------------------------------

# all the files will be in ~environment/aws-iot-core-workshop
# YOU WILL HAVE ALREADY completed the following:
# cd ~/environment
# git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-iot-core-workshop.git
# install the AWS IoT SDK for Python for access to its samples, in particular 'samples/ThingShadowEcho/ThingShadowEcho.py'
# cd ~/environment
# git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python.git



# prep Cloud9 environment
#sudo pip install --upgrade pip
pip-3.6 install --user httpie AWSIoTPythonSDK
sudo yum install -y jq
echo [default] > ~/.aws/config
echo region=us-west-2 >> ~/.aws/config


# what we'll call this device
# CHANGE THIS LINE TO YOUR NAME AND FAV COLOR

THING_NAME=LastNameFavoriteColor

# letâ€™s work in our workshop folder
cd ~/environment/aws-iot-core-workshop/code

# find out what AWS endpoint we'll connect to
# can also see on the console at: https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-west-2#/settings
aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS | tee endpoint-setup.out

# download the Amazon root certificate, used to validate we're connecting to Amazon
# also listed at: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/managing-device-certs.html
wget -O root-ca.pem https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem

# create a new thing
aws iot create-thing --thing-name ${THING_NAME} | tee create-thing.out

# now can see on the IoT console at: https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home?region=us-west-2#/thinghub
# alternatively these steps can be done from the console, by creating a new Thing and accepting defaults
# then copying all the device key and certificate files to your environment
# but we're using the CLI here so that we can see each step along the way

# create a policy for the thing
aws iot create-policy --policy-name ${THING_NAME}-Policy --policy-document '{  "Version": "2012-10-17",  "Statement": [ {  "Effect": "Allow",  "Action": "iot:*",  "Resource": "*" }  ]}' | tee create-policy.out

# create private/public keys and a certificate for this thing
aws iot create-keys-and-certificate --set-as-active --certificate-pem-outfile service-certificate.pem --public-key-outfile thing-public.key --private-key-outfile thing-private.key | tee create-certs.out

# get cert arn
CERT_ARN=$(jq -r .certificateArn < create-certs.out)

# attach policy to thing and certificate
aws iot attach-principal-policy --policy-name ${THING_NAME}-Policy --principal $CERT_ARN
aws iot attach-thing-principal --thing-name ${THING_NAME} --principal $CERT_ARN

# view principles
aws iot list-thing-principals --thing-name ${THING_NAME}
aws iot list-principal-policies --principal $CERT_ARN

# get the endpoint
IOT_ENDPOINT=$(jq -r .endpointAddress < endpoint-setup.out)
